# Waste Classification Project 🗑️🤖

## Overview ℹ️
This project is dedicated to classifying waste items into distinct categories like degradable, bio-degradable, paper, metal, or plastic, utilizing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With this AI model, you can simply input an image of a waste item, and it will accurately predict its category.


## How it Works 🛠️
The project employs advanced deep learning techniques to train a neural network model on a specific dataset containing images of various waste items. This model learns to discern key features from these images and categorize them into different waste categories. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the category of any new waste item by analyzing its image.


## Dataset 📊
The dataset used for training the AI model is meticulously curated, encompassing a wide array of images portraying different types of waste items. Each image is meticulously labeled with its corresponding waste category, ensuring the model learns to classify them accurately. The dataset is preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets to facilitate efficient model training and evaluation.


## Model Training 🧠
The AI model is trained using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Throughout the training process, the model learns to recognize intricate patterns and features within the input images that signify different waste categories. The model's parameters are optimized iteratively to minimize classification errors and enhance its accuracy.


## Evaluation 📈
To evaluate the model's performance, it undergoes rigorous testing using a separate test dataset. Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to gauge the model's efficacy in accurately classifying waste items into their respective categories.


## Deployment 🚀
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be seamlessly deployed as a service or integrated into applications for real-time waste classification. Users can simply input images of waste items, and the model will promptly predict their respective categories, providing invaluable insights for waste management and recycling endeavors.
